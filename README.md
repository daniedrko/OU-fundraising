# OU-fundraising
The working and shiny app files used for a story on OU's Promise Lives Fundraising Campaign (2007-2015)

I created a Shiny app, and did some analysis using data I received from Ohio University's recent fundraising campaign.
The data, which I retrieved through public records request, details all donations to OU's campaign from 2007-15 (and a few before that).

My shiny app is here: http://dk-o.shinyapps.io/promise-lives-top10
